# Kubernetes and pulumi
Pulumi can be so handy when it comes to kubernetes cluster and application deployment. we love Hashicorm Terraform but pulumi is also fun in its own ways.

Pulumi’s Cloud Native SDK makes it easy to target any Kubernetes environment to provision a cluster, configure and deploy applications, and update them as required.

Pulumi supports programming against Kubernetes—Minikube, on-premises and cloud-hosted custom Kubernetes clusters, and the managed services from Google (GKE), Azure (AKS), and Amazon (EKS). The Pulumi Kubernetes provider packages and CLI help you accomplish all these within minutes.

We are using **Python** as the language to build of codes.
